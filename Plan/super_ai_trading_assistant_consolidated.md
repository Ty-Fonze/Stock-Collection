## **Blueprint**

### **Functionality Breakdown**
#### **Flask and Dash Integration**
- **Flask (`server`)**:
  - Provides the backend for the Dash application.
  - Handles potential future API or database integrations.
- **Dash (`app`)**:
  - Manages the frontend dashboard logic and layout.
  - Hosts the interactive user interface.

#### **Stock Data Analysis**
- **`fetch_spy_data()`**:
  - Fetches SPY stock data for the last 3 months using the `yfinance` library.
  - Computes the following technical indicators:
    - Bollinger Bands (Upper and Lower).
    - 20-day Moving Average (MA20).
    - Relative Strength Index (RSI).

#### **Visualization**
- **`create_combined_chart(data)`**:
  - Generates a Plotly candlestick chart with:
    - Bollinger Bands overlay.
    - RSI line chart with thresholds (30 and 70).
  - Uses a dark theme for improved visual appeal.

#### **Dashboard Layout**
- **Header Section**:
  - Displays:
    - Adeptus Mechanicus Logo with a "breathing" animation effect.
    - Title: "Super AI Trading Assistant".
    - Welcome Description: Explains the purpose of the dashboard.
- **Main Dashboard Content**:
  - **Left Column**: Live Market Data (TradingView widget).
  - **Right Column**: Technical Analysis Chart (Plotly candlestick chart with indicators).
- **Additional Sections**:
  - **Real-Time News Alerts**: Placeholder for live news and sentiment analysis.
  - **AI Insights**: Placeholder for AI-driven predictions and market opportunities.

#### **Future Enhancements**
- Populate placeholders with live data and AI insights.
- Add user customization options for layout and widgets.
- Connect to a database for storing user preferences and historical data.

## **Progress Timeline**

### **Phase 1: Foundation**
- Set up TradingView and Webull APIs for data collection.
- Automated scripts for intraday data fetching and processing.
- Built a Python script to fetch price and options data for SPY, AAPL, and QQQ using `yfinance`.
- Implemented essential technical indicators: SMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, VWAP, and Stochastic Oscillator.
- Created Flask-based dashboard for real-time news alerts with sentiment analysis.

### **Phase 2: Visualizations**
- Designed a combined candlestick chart with Plotly (`create_combined_chart()`).
- Built a React app to serve as the front-end interface.
- Designed a drag-and-drop widget dashboard using the **react-grid-layout** library.

### **Phase 3: Opportunity Monitoring**
- Developed logic for real-time data monitoring and alerts based on:
  - Price levels (support/resistance).
  - Volatility spikes.
  - Unusual options activity.

### **Phase 4: Interactive Features**
- Integrated a conversational interface via CLI, Telegram bot, or web app.
- Added persistent layout storage using `localStorage`.
