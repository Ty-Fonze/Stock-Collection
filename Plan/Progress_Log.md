# **Super AI Trading Assistant - Progress Log**

## **Project Overview**
The **Super AI Trading Assistant** is an interactive dashboard designed to provide users with actionable financial insights through data visualization, technical analysis, and AI-driven predictions. The project is built using the Dash framework (Python) for the front-end and Flask for the backend, with capabilities for real-time updates and advanced technical indicators.
