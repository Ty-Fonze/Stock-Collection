## **Functionality Breakdown**

### **1. Flask and Dash Integration**
- **Flask (`server`)**:
  - Provides the backend for the Dash application.
  - Handles potential future API or database integrations.
- **Dash (`app`)**:
  - Manages the frontend dashboard logic and layout.
  - Hosts the interactive user interface.

---

### **2. Stock Data Analysis**
- **`fetch_spy_data()`**:
  - Fetches SPY stock data for the last 3 months using the `yfinance` library.
  - Computes the following technical indicators:
    - **Bollinger Bands** (Upper and Lower).
    - **20-day Moving Average (MA20)**.
    - **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**.

---

### **3. Visualization**
- **`create_combined_chart(data)`**:
  - Generates a Plotly candlestick chart with:
    - Bollinger Bands overlay.
    - RSI line chart with thresholds (30 and 70).
  - Uses a dark theme for improved visual appeal.

---

### **4. Dashboard Layout**
#### **Header Section**
- Displays:
  - **Adeptus Mechanicus Logo**:
    - Positioned centrally with a "breathing" animation effect.
  - **Title**: "Super AI Trading Assistant".
  - **Welcome Description**: Explains the purpose of the dashboard.

#### **Main Dashboard Content**
- Split into two columns for better organization:
  - **Left Column: Live Market Data**:
    - Embedded `TradingView` widget displaying a live SPY chart.
  - **Right Column: Technical Analysis Chart**:
    - Plotly candlestick chart with Bollinger Bands and RSI.

#### **Additional Sections**
- **Real-Time News Alerts**:
  - Placeholder for live news and sentiment analysis.
- **AI Insights**:
  - Placeholder for AI-driven predictions and market opportunities.

---

### **5. Custom Styling**
- **CSS Animations**:
  - Applies a "breathing" effect to the logo using keyframes.
- **Dark Theme**:
  - Consistent visual style across all sections.

---

### **6. Future Enhancements**
- Populate the **News Alerts** section with live news feeds and sentiment analysis.
- Integrate AI predictions into the **AI Insights** section.
- Add user customization options for the layout and widgets.
- Connect to a database for storing user preferences and historical data.

---

## **How It Works**
1. **Data Fetching**:
   - `fetch_spy_data()` is called to retrieve and process SPY data.
2. **Visualization**:
   - `create_combined_chart()` is used to generate the candlestick chart with indicators.
3. **Dashboard Rendering**:
   - The layout is defined in `app.layout` and rendered by Dash.
4. **Custom HTML and CSS**:
   - Customized with animations and a dark theme.
