# Super AI Trading Assistant Plan

## **Overview**
The goal is to build a comprehensive AI-powered assistant for 0DTE (Zero Days to Expiry) options trading, primarily focusing on SPY puts but adaptable to any stock or index. The assistant will act like a "Super Brain," providing detailed analyses, predictions, visualizations, and actionable insights. It will proactively offer insights and respond to queries in an interactive, professor-like manner.

## **Core Features**

### 1. **Market Rundown**
- **Daily Market Summary**:
  - Provide an overview of SPY’s intraday performance.
  - Highlight key levels (support/resistance), trends, and sentiment.

---

### 11. **Integration with Tools**
- APIs for real-time data:

  - Semi-automated trade execution (alerts, not direct orders).

---

### 12. **Interactive Interface**
- A conversational interface to interact with the assistant:
  - **CLI (Command-Line Interface)**: Simple and efficient.
